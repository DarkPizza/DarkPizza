# Hello! üëãüèª
Welcome to my Github, you won't find much here, since most of the stuff I do is for clients and private projects.

## About Me üë¶
My name is Artur, I am currently 19 years old, I live in the ABC region in S√£o Paulo. I am currently taking a course in Electromechanics at [ETEC](https://www.vestibulinhoetec.com.br/home/), I have also completed courses in Vectorial Art, Image Composition, Video Composition and Effects and Audiovisual at [Escola Saga](https://www.saga.com.br/).

Programming is a Hobby, however, I enjoy more doing Customer Service for my Discord programming store, the [BreakingStore](https://github.com/BreakingStore), where I sell Bots for Discord and some Windows programs.

My main interest, is to become even more professional in Electromechanics, for a future job.

## Alfacusa
Well, I would like to introduce you to Alfacusa, a Discord Roleplay bot with over **95,000** servers and thousands of users spread all over Brazil.<br/>
This is currently the **biggest project** I have ever done in my life and it is certainly where my **love for making bots for Discord** came from.
